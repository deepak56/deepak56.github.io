I am always bookmarking interesting tutorials that I would do one fine day. Since that day never comes, I have aimed to do one tutorial each day. The topics would broadly be programming, marketing and productivity hacks. All credit to the original tutorial - I am just thinking aloud as I type my notes. 

Day 1: Getting started with Octopress http://dev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-octopress--webdesign-11442

Since I am using Ubuntu 12.04 - the tips might or might not be applicable to you. 

Octopress is a static blogging framework that calls itself “A blogging framework for hackers”. The above tutorial does a good job of explaining what is the difference between such a static framework and something like Wordpress that needs to ‘do’ something on the server before becoming viewable. 

Octopress in itself is pretty famous and the default theme is used by a lot of programmers. I was a bit wary that the Octopress site hasn’t been updated for a few years and toyed with the idea of trying out Pelican - that does almost the same thing but is Python based. Maybe, will do that later. 

##Installing everything: 

You would need Ruby version 1.9.3 or above for this to work. And since my machine didn’t have that I had to use the Ruby Version Manager (rvm). 

As soon as I put in the first command of the tutorial, out popped the message that rvm on Ubuntu is unusable. Good thing though that the link given pointed to a Stackoverflow answer that worked perfectly. 

You had to remove the rvm completely and reinstall as per these instructions. 

To start using RVM you need to run something like `source /home/user/.rvm/scripts/rvm`

Follow the instructions, and finally when it all ends run the command ruby --version. It should output to the latest one. I now have 2.1.0

With Ruby you also need RubyGems - a package management framework for Ruby. If you don’t already have that head over to here. Broadly, the programs/libraries/codes in Ruby are in a self contained format called a gem. With RubyGems you can install any of these open source packages directly from the command line. 

We will install the Jekyll & Bundler gems. Jekyll in itself is a pretty famous static site generator while Bundler will allow to manage dependencies better. 

	gem install Jekyll
	gem install Bundler

So with the ancillaries installed, we will install the Octopress bundle. I have a Projects folder in my desktop, where I put in a Sites/mysite structure. Follow the instructions as given. 

	cd Projects/Sites
	git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git mysite

	cd mysite
	bundle install

Installing the default Octopress theme:

	rake install


##Ready to run

A command to start a new post 

	rake new_post["A post"]

And we are ready to preview

	rake preview

Okay so that worked out pretty well. Time to learn some Markdown
